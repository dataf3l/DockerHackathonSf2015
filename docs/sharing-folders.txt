brew install sshfs

# run container and create folder/volume for sshfs to mount
$ docker run -p 49001:49001 -v /shared:/shared user/image

$ sshfs -p 2022 docker@localhost:/shared ~/shared

I've now got access to the /shared folder inside the container, shown as a mounted drive in OSX.

Hopefully this might help someone.

Thanks @haad for the pointer
